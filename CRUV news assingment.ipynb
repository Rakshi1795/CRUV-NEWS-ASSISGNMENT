       "'After reaching his hotel in the city, RM revealed that his stay would be for four days and added that he would step out for dinner. As he sat at a roadside open-air restaurant, RM feasted on beer, burgers and fries. He said, \"I\\'m starving right now. I\\'m out to grab some food. It\\'s much quieter than I expected and feels like a rural town. I like the familiar atmosphere.\" RM attended Art Basel and explained on camera the details of the art fair. He also gave a glimpse as he had noodles and beer which was followed by soup noodles and wrap. Showing the pattern of a ping pong table, RM said, \"The table looks like our (BTS) symbol.\" He also spoke about the art pieces as he viewed them. After that, RM took a tram to visit the Foundation Beyeler, a museum. He later took a walk through the city. On his third day, RM visited the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Vitra Design Museum and the gallery. As he walked around, RM showed a chair to his fans and said, \"I have breaking news for you guys. Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin made a chair and it\\'s displayed in the Vitra Design Museum. If you see this Chris, give me a call. You\\'re amazing.\" RM next visited Lucerne and hiked to Mount Rigi. Recalling his previous visit to Lucerne, RM added, \"I remember the day of crossing that bridge and buying souvenirs.\" He was also reminded of Bon Voyage, a reality show featuring BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Speaking to the camera, RM said, \"I rode the SSB train to Lucerne, rode a boat, rode the mountain train, walked down the track road, rode the cable cars, and now I\\'m on a boat planning to go ride the SSB again.\" RM\\'s travel in Switzerland ended with a visit to the Museum Tinguely. Next, RM flew to Paris to attend the Pinault Collection and to visit Musee d\\'Orsay. He then went to Centre Georges-Pompidou and Orsay Museum. RM\\'s vlog ended with him enjoying a Korean meal and then heading back to Seoul.'"

And when it was released, BTS ARMY had turned into Sherlock and had found Taetae aka BTS V in the video. J-Hope's More video featured a glimpse of Kim Taehyung. And now, the new video confirms the theory of ARMYs that V indeed make a cameo in J-Hope's More MV BTS V shocked and surprised J-Hope as he was shooting for his MV, More. He was engrossed in the scene of the shoot and was pleasantly surprised to see Kim Taehyung on the sets. Hobi couldn't stop smiling and was grateful for V to come and cheer on him. J-Hope was seen proudly introducing Kim Taehyung to the cast and crew around on the sets of More. Taetae is one of the biggest cheerleaders of the hyung and the rapline and he has proved it a lot of times already. And seeing him cheer on J-Hope while filming the song More was another proof of his love for his hyungs and their work Taehyung quickly jumped at the opportunity and asked J-Hope if he could be one of the mannequins in his MV. The mannequins were the artists/extras who were extremely still in the video. Kim Taehyung quickly took off his jacket and took place in the rear of the shot. After shooting the scene, Hobi quickly deduces that ARMYs will right away catch his cameo in the MV. And he was right! As soon as the More MV was released, ARMY did indeed catch Kim Taehyung in his tee, jacket and slippers with his toes sticking out. ARMY has a keen eye and a knack for dissecting the MVs and the Bangtan Boys also know how ARMY's mind works. It's rare to see a Boyband and their fandom know each other so well A couple of hours ago, J-Hope shared a new teaser. This time, it's called Hope in the Box. It seems like a new single or a new teaser of his album Jack in the Box. It looks quite sinister and dark. Hobi is experimenting with his music, style and even himself with his new album. Must say, this break to explore themselves as artists is working amazingly well for them       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

He didn't mind doing another take just for the right shot. Jungkook also gave inputs of his own while shooting for the song and was his confident self, as always One thing that can be noticed in Dreamers MV shoot BTS is that Jungkook felt quite hot due to the hot weather in Qatar. He called the residents of Qatar invincible for dealing with all the heat. The assistants were seen holding handheld fans to keep Jungkook cool as well. Despite the heat, Jungkook found Qatar beautiful. He also talked about seeing ARMYs up close and thanked them for cheering on him while he shot for the MV In the video, we can see Jungkook taking off his jacket since it is hot. It has exposed the tattoos on his arm. ARMY is going crazy over his sleeve-length tattoos. Some even cannot get over his adorable interaction with a falcon.

members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook said they were taking a break, The Korea Singers Association president Lee Ja Yeon on Wednesday requested the group to 'reconsider the decision to go on a group hiatus'  In an official statement, Lee Ja Yeon urged the members to rethink the call 'for the future of South Korea's music industry'  In the note, she also said that it's 'difficult to hope for the next BTS to emerge any time soon'  The statement also read that if BTS 'goes away' then the group's fandom ARMY will also follow suit  (Also Read | BTS' RM thinks he 'hit a kind of wall', says he needs to create music 'that’s more timeless')Recently, during BTS' Festa dinner, the group revealed that will take a break  After their announcement, ARMY supported their decision for taking rest  However, HYBE later clarified that BTS is not taking a hiatus  BTS members, RM, V and Jungkook individually also told fans that they will not go on a hiatus nor are they disbanding  They recently announced their anthology album Proof  Lee Ja Yeon's statement, as quoted by Allkpop, read, \"I'm overcome by my fear and concern that the 'BTS Hallyu Wave', a movement possessing the greatest cultural soft power that the world has ever witnessed, will vanish soon  In the years leading up to the birth of this movement, it was believed that finding the 'Next Beatles' would be a very difficult achievement, and now, we have arrived at a point where it is difficult to hope for the 'Next BTS' to emerge any time soon  Thus, there is great concern that the heartbeat of Hallyu will cease  The decision to publish this statement was not an easy one  Please, will you reconsider the decision to go on a group hiatus, for the future of South Korea's music industry?\"She added \"If BTS goes away, the missionaries of Hallyu and Korean culture, ARMYs, also go away  South Korea's tourism industry will suffer, and it will be difficult to hope for a future for South Korea as a hub of culture in Asia  The special laws allotted to the sports and the classical music and arts industries for mandatory military service must be extended to popular culture as well  The need for attention and action regarding this existing issue is pressing  The government and the national assembly of South Korea must pay mind to this matter so that the Hallyu boom can continue to spread, and BTS can continue to promote actively as a group  Please pursue a revision of existing military service laws \"Reacting to the statement, ARMY took to Twitter saying the request was 'wrong' and urged BTS to take rest  A fan tweeted, \"This is so wrong the amount of pressure she's putting on them  They are taking a break and it's a must for their health now  No one has the right to demand  Everyone should understand this  Just give them time to rest  Bts, Army forever \"“You’ve done so much for us already! take as much time as you need and enjoy it, we’ll always be waiting for you #BTSItsOkayToRest,\"

In one of them, V, popularly known as Kim Taehyung, is seen softly gazing towards the camera in an all-white look at an outdoor setting, in another he is seen patiently waiting outside a bedroom while the last one is a close-up shot of him making eye contact. All of these as a part of a surprise second set of pictures from his first solo photoshoot for the magazine as the members are focusing on solo careers. Reacting to the sweet surprise, BTS ARMY took to Twitter and started trending V with hashtags like #TAEHYUNGxVOGUE. One fan wrote, “the SerVe absolutely stunning and gorgeous as always! V ICON OF AN ERA V FOR VOGUE KOREA.” “Belongs in a museum!!” commented another fan. Someone else added jokingly, “This is illegal to be this fine.” Earlier on August 27, fans started speculating about the photo shoot after the magazine’s fashion director posted an update on Instagram Stories hinting about a photoshoot likely with a BTS member. She shared a sneak peek of the styling reference and later deleted it, which raise further speculations. Later on September 4, the same magazine's editor-in-chief and other associates confirmed the rumours with a glimpse of V’s upcoming photoshoot. A few days later, the first preview of V’s pictorial was released and confirmed the schedule for the cover, which people ‘will remember for ages.’ This was also followed by a throwback interview with V. The magazine will next release a film teaser of the BTS member on September 16 as per their schedule of the pictorial. BTS consists ofmembers RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Amid their solo projects, the group will be reuniting soon for their upcoming free concert in Busan on October 15 for the World Expo 2030.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

of the band's 2020 album. The fans are convinced that other members of the K-pop group must have also gotten similar tattoos, as they had previously discussed on several occasions. V had spoken about it on Weverse, saying, “We’ve been talking about friendship tattoos forever. We’ll do it someday. Please look forward to it.” RM had also talked about it in a V Live, revealing that they have had discussions about getting a friendship tattoo. He had said, \"Let’s tattoo seven dots or do seven of something. Or just simply tattoo the number seven. But if we’re actually doing it, I want to do it on the ankle. You know, it’s simple.” RM went with his last idea and tattooed the number seven on his ankle. ARMY flooded Twitter with comments about the tattoo. One wrote, \"OMG they got the 7 tattoo,\" while another commented, \"They finally did it.\" A third one wrote, \"OMGGG the friendship tattoo. I am screaming, crying.\" Another said, \"They freaking did it they got the tattooooooo.\" BTS will soon celebrate the ninth anniversary of its debut. They will also perform their album Proof live to mark the occasion on June 13, for which they will be joined by a 'special guest.'       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

I'm guessing it felt like that even more because it was a year we weren't able to meet you guys that often, isn't it? But still, I think that there were many things that happened this year despite it going by so fast. We laughed cried and were so happy meeting you guys after so long since Covid-19 was over, we released our album and had promotions, we hard a large-scale concert in my hometown Busan, we were able to witness the performances of the albums Hobi hyung and Namjoon hyung worked hard preparing for, and our Seokjin hyung enlisted as well. Hehe.” Jimin shared how he has been busy working on his music and meeting composers. “I just want all of us to go to a place where all of you are there and sing, hear you sing together with us while waving your army bombs, and look at you smile. I keep longing for that always. I think I feel like that cause we weren't able to meet as much as each other wanted to. I somewhat can't put my words together unlike the previous years, I don't know what I'm saying or what I mean. I just hate worrying you, hate making you wait and I feel sorry about it and yet I'm thankful to you and I miss you and I want to do better (for you) and I'm just spending this year that way and sending it off everyone. Wishing you a very Happy New Year !Don't get hurt and don't get hurt and be happy and have a happy new year. I love you and love you again,” he also added. On the other hand, Jungkook who has been away from social media for a while, posted, “Receive a lot of blessings for the New Year (happy new year) ARMY 2023! Every time! Always! I hope you (all) are healthy and happy I hope you guys don't get sick/hurt physically or emotionally.” V aka Kim Taehyung who recently turned a year older, joined the social bandwagon. He added to fans, “Receive a lot of blessings for the New Year (happy new year) I hope everyone is healthy this year and starts (the year) with a happy day.” Responding to everyone’s post, J-Hope sent them love. Meanwhile, fans have taken to Twitter to react to the heartfelt wishes from BTS members. BTS consists of RM, Jin, SUGA, J-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook. Currently, Jin is serving in South Korean army.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

I was like 'wow, he can sing very beautifully' and when I turned to look, it was Jungkook BTS. At first, I'm not sure so I asked other people, 'Does Jungkook have his lower right lip pierced?' My friend said to look at the tattoos on his hand and it's really him lol.\" Reacting to the post, a fan wrote, \"Thank you for waiting till the end to ask for autograph & let our Kookie enjoy the show. I'm so thankful she respected his privacy! and Jungkook is the sweetest. All of his interactions whenever he meets ARMYs are so sweet & special!!\" Another person said, \"You are a lucky girl. Thanks for respecting his privacy and approaching him at the proper time.\" \"The fact that JK took the time to ask where she's from? Then proceeded to greet her in her language? My heart just melted. Why is he so pure and kind?\" read a tweet. On Saturday, Jungkook headed to Washington, D.C. for BTS' meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House. In videos and pictures shared online by fans, Jungkook sent finger hearts to fans and saluted them. He also bowed to the paparazzi inside the Seoul airport. BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin and V will arrive in the US on Sunday.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

Jeon Jungkook makes fun of whatever you do so but I'd end up laughing every time (Jungkook followed Yoongi's choreo). The members monitored the music video a lot for me. I was in the middle of filming when it came out so they told me then I couldn't watch (the MV). It was the same around Daechwita, I can't really watch the MV I'm on as much,\" Twitter user @BTStranslation_ quoted Suga. Suga also said, as translated by @rmkkyu, \"Originally, I was only going to feature, only feature in the music video. I was only going to feature and then leave but… one thing led to another, I danced.\" Suga also said, as per @rmkkyu, the filming location for That That and Permission To Dance was the same, and the car model for That That and Daechwita was also the same. As translated by @BTStranslation_ , Suga had sent another song to PSY which he said no to at first. The song was detailed but PSY wanted to do a different style, so they ended up doing That That. Suga wrote the hook/chorus That That I Like That and PSY wrote the other parts. That That, part of PSY's latest album PSY 9th, released on April 29 and has been produced by Suga. Talking about the collaboration with PSY, Suga had said as quoted by news agency ANI, \"At first, because he's many years my senior and someone who's well-respected in the business I was quite nervous. It felt like working with a childhood friend so it made the songwriting process that much more fun. We became besties in a way.\" The album has 12 songs, including one featuring Korean-Canadian rapper Tablo. Meanwhile, BTS' logo trailer for their new album, titled Proof, was released recently. The new album will have a mix of new and old songs and will be an anthology album. In a statement, BigHit Music had said, “After ceaselessly sprinting forward since 2013, BTS is celebrating their 9th anniversary this coming June. It is all thanks to ARMY who have sent us your unwavering love and support. The BTS anthology album that embodies the history of BTS will be released as they begin a new chapter as an artist that has been active for nine years to look back on their past endeavours.\" It added, “The anthology album Proof that consists of three CDs includes many different tracks - including three all-new tracks - that reflect the thoughts and ideas of the members on the past, present and future of BTS. We hope that you look forward to BTS’ anthology album Proof, and relive the history that BTS and ARMY made together so far, and will continue to make in the future to come.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

            BLACKPINK delighted their fans last night as they officially kicked off their comeback activities by posting an exciting video titled 'BORN PINK' announcement trailer, giving a roadmap for the next few months. BLACKPINK members, including Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo and Rosé, dropped the video on their respective Instagram accounts. Apart from giving the exciting comeback news to BLINKs, BLACKPINK member Lisa also delighted them by posting new selfies of herself dressed in a black corset crop top and denim jeans. Her fans could not keep calm and took to the comments section to express the same. Lisa styled her classic fit by ditching all accessories and embracing the casual aesthetics. Additionally, the rapper left her messy blonde mane open in centre parting, and for the glam, she opted for a no-makeup look with glowing skin, blushed cheeks, and nude pink lip shade. After Lisa dropped the pictures, BLINKs took to the comments section to shower her with compliments. One fan wrote, \"Why are you so beautiful.\" Another commented, \"We love you, queen.\" A few netizens also posted heart-eye emoticons to show their love for the musician. Meanwhile, BLACKPINK is all set to make its comeback in August. They will release a pre-release single this month, followed by the girl group's new album release in September.

album Pink Venom. They are in the US. The girls went on the Jimmy Kimmel show where they did a live performance of the song. It seems Rose outdid herself with her moves and amazing vocals. Now, the host said that 'kids' were super excited to see BLACKPINK on the Kimmel stage. This has not gone down well with K-Pop fans. It is a known fact that the popular groups have fans across age groups and ethnicities. Some time back, James Corden referred to BTS fans as 15-year-old fangirls and ARMY did not take it lightly at all. In fact, the host apologized to RM aka Kim Namjoon when they came on the show during the LA Concert promotions Now, Kim Jisoo had to miss the 2022 Seoul Drama Awards to be present for the promotions of Pink Venom. She was awarded the Best Actress for Snowdrop. Blinks and solo fans of Jisoo are upset that she had to miss out because of Jimmy Kimmel. Some have even termed the performance as boring. They feel YG Entertainment should have done better with the promotions of Pink Venom. Snowdrop saw a heartfelt performance from Kim Jisoo. This was her acting debut Jisoo's vocals have also got praise in the Blackpink comeback. The singer is seen as the eldest sister of the group, and has been their emotional anchor. Kim Jisoo won at the fan voted event. Even Kim Seon-Ho who is world famous for his poignant acting in Hometown Cha Cha won an award       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Some asked the singer if he was okay, while others said they are in tears on not being able to find the posts. One wrote, \"I think he just didn’t like his Insta pics anymore and chose to delete them. A lot of people do that all the time,\" while another commented, \"Jungkook!!?? What is happening?\" A third one wrote, \"Doesn’t make sense to delete all of that, including personal photos and videos over a possible collab. It does seem strange. Hope all is ok.\" Many believed it was part of the promotions of BTS' upcoming album Proof. Referring to the album's title track Yet To Come, a fan asked, \"No posts yet/Yet to Come. coincidence??? I think not!! #BTS_Proof.\" Another wrote, \"I wonder is he doing what western artist do usually before they release albums. Or is his account got h@-cked?\" Meanwhile, fans noticed Jungkook's voice in his bandmate J-Hope's Instagram Stories, in which he was saying, \"Even when I take pictures of food, there's nothing I do with it.\" Jungkook, along with his bandmates RM, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, Suga, and V, is currently in Washington, D.C. for their meeting with the United States President Joe Biden. They are also gearing up for the release of their upcoming album Proof on June 10.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

It’s time to run. Our favourite variety show starring the hilarious members- RM, Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook of BTS, ‘Run BTS’ is back next week. After a break of 10 months, the squad returns with their chaos on August 16.In a new clip shared ahead of the premiere, the teaser of the special episode has been revealed. Titled ‘Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Telepathy Part 0’, the seven boys of the group make their grand return. At the start of the teaser, we can see the septet marking the historic day by cheering with a glass of what appears to be champagne and shouting out their iconic ‘Run BTS’ in style.The group then engages in a fun game of telepathy where they are tested on their knowledge of each other. Initially calling themselves ‘one body and soul’, they soon turn confused with all the information coming their way. Questioning their memories and sifting through more than a decade of content, they eventually- albeit reluctantly- admit to not being good at the game. Soon, they are dragged to a new location with blindfolds on their eyes and only each other to guide them on the path.Check out the teaser below.https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpKFqkDz4ccInterestingly, a new theme song greets the viewers and like we are sure most of them must have already guessed it, BTS’ song ‘Run BTS’, off of their latest album ‘Proof’ plays in the background. Their latest photos from the comeback also greet the fans in the most chic ways possible.Are you excited for the return of ‘Run BTS’?Join the biggest community of K-Pop fans live on Pinkvilla Rooms to get one step closer to your favourite K-Celebs!

Given the intense feelings of fans, BTS tends to be a bit wary about responding to romantic lines written by them. But that does not mean that they are not romantic. Some days back, the Dalmajung Merch collection was released by BTS. The items are very pretty. But even more are the love letters written by BTS for ARMYs. Yes, Dalmajung means in Korean to meet the moon. Like Bollywood films, in Korean the moon is symbolic of love, longing and lovers. The boys have written thoughts for ARMYs and we cannot help but swoon It can be said comfortably that the hyung line of BTS is much more romantic than we assume them to be. The English translation of the letters will make you think so. From yearning about lovers to sending love-soaked lines about fleeting moments of togetherness, the boys have shown that they can bring it on when it comes to romance ARMY has gone crazy after reading this. Like no one would expect Bangtan Boys to write love letters for fans. Check out some of the crazy reactions here BTS aka Bangtan Boys is loved all over the globe for their artistry, humility, charm and good looks. But desi fans must have noticed how these love letters are so similar to Bollywood's references of the moon, love and longing       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival.

      "After launching in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS respectively released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark &amp; Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group&#39;s second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean wave into the United States and breaking several sales records. They became the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single Mic Drop, as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).&nbsp;\n",

      "BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles in 1966&ndash;1968 with four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single Dynamite. Their follow-up releases Savage Love, Life Goes On, Butter, and Permission to Dance made them the quickest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.\n",

       BTS fans aka ARMY have travelled in large numbers for the Busan concert. As we know, the boys might join the military after this. Many ARMYs did not wish to miss out on the experience of seeing them live. The Busan concert is slated to be one of the biggest in Korea, and in fact the world. Visuals of the Yet To Come bus and container being ferried for the concert went viral. Now, Busan is also the hometown of Jimin and Jungkook. Fans of BTS who come to Busan make a stop at Magnate, which is the cafe owned by Jimin's dad. It looks like business has been brisk in the past few days Jimin's father's cafe Magnate is known to be quite decently priced in Busan, and the coffee quality is good too. Fans are enjoying lattes, tiramisu cakes and other stuff BTS will be performing this weekend at the Yet To Come Busan concert. Jimin's birthday is being celebrated with projects all over the world. One of the maknaes of BTS, Park Jimin is immensely loved all over       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

A clip is going viral from the show where BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon says he grew up believing that marriage was a normal part of growing up, and something everyone had to do. But as he grew up, he realised the enormity of the whole decision and how it is scary. And he said that self realization came that what is the standard norm might not be the best choice for him The words have found resonance with many ARMYs. As we know, BTS never discusses their personal life. They avoid talking about dating and stuff too. This is one of the rare occasions when someone has said something. Like Namjoon, the thought is very relatable yet profound.

Music critics feel it is one of the albums of the year. He went for the promotions of the album on Psick Show, which is a popular one on YouTube. From the moment he walked in, it was evident that he is a huge fan of the show. In fact, ARMY got to see a totally new side of Kim Namjoon aka RM. He was at his goofiest and wittiest best. From revealing that he too worries about spending excessively on wedding gifts being a billionaire to discussing his ideas of a good time with friends, he was a hoot But chaos ensued when he found out that one of the hosts of the Psick Show. Mukgo, had ties to SK Energy. It seems both their fathers were part of the same organisation. He jumped up from the seat in excitement. It seems his dad worked in the offices located in Seoul and Incheon. Kim Namjoon aka RM said that his father wanted him to study engineering as working in the oil and gas industry meant a good salary. We are sure millions of desi kids will relate to this sentiment of his dad. Check out some of the tweets here It seems RM's father is retired now. He had mentioned that his mom works in real estate. Fans are surprised knowing that he too comes from a well-heeled family like Kim Seokjin       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

And some are pretty obsessive ones. The three young members are also the faves of shippers. While celebrating the friendship between members is fine, it is problematic when people assume they are couple. Of late, a smear campaign on Kim Taehyung by JiKook shippers from Japan was exposed. The campaign planned to bring disrepute to the name of BTS V aka Kim Taehyung as the fans believed that Jungkook and Jimin were the real thing. The campaign was exposed by a Japanese fan who said that genuine ARMYs from the country were reporting such malicious mischief-makers However, now Weverse has been flooded with hate comments about Kim Taehyung. ARMYs are downright disgusted with the whole development. Of late, there has been too much drama around BTS V aka Kim Taehyung. The whole dating rumor with Blackpink rapper Jennie Kim kept him in the news and how. This is how ARMY has reacted to the recent spate of hate comments on Weverse. Take a look We  can see that BTS fans are super upset with what has happened. The Winter Bear singer Kim Taehyung is rumoured to be on a variety show that will be filmed in Mexico. Jungkook is going to perform solo at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

this time around- even more so  How?Jung Hoseok, born on February 18, 1994 is a South Korean rapper, singer, dancer, songwriter, record producer and the absolute source of everything bright and hopeful for his fellow members of the iconic septet BTS as well as their unimaginably large throng of fans, ARMYs spread around the world  But that’s all the information we already know of Making his first full length album release and being the first from his group to officially do so, J-Hope dropped ‘Jack In The Box’ on July 15  A couple of weeks since its release and the album has broken multiple records, understandably so  Today, we take a look at the many reasons why it works with a track by track breakdown of this 10-song record Intro: It is unbelievable if any other start to the album could be as perfect as this one, as it very obviously traces back to the roots of what being J-Hope stands for  Taking a page from the tale of ‘Pandora’s Box’ where ‘hope’ is the last remaining item, a woman’s voice reads out the story  It is genius and very reflective of the contents of the album Pandora’s Box: Right on cue, this track meets the audiences as a scroll from the past  J-Hope’s existence is painted over his will to go back to his basics to open his own box that reveals a token his moniker MORE: The pre-release single saw J-Hope taking on a challenging and effective peep into his journey as an artist and a thirst for even ‘MORE’  With old school hip-hop beats he admits to self-learning and his readiness to fail in the process of creating art STOP: The Korean name for the song translates to ‘There Are No Bad People In The World’ and it is depictive of J-Hope’s beliefs  A world riddled with sad happenings is still a world full of people who never wish to be bad  The artist’s humane tendencies rumble through the softer tones of the track where asks people to stop fighting, it’s more hopeful than decisive = (Equal Sign): The song is deep rooted into J-Hope’s understanding of people  He desires an equal stature and belts out the many reasons why he thinks it makes the perfect sense  “Hate'll paralyze your mind/ Gotta see the other side”, hopeful indeed Music Box : Reflection: It is the perfect breather to go over the class change in style of music that J-Hope has presented so far  The audio is that of an eerie music playing from the toy that the album’s art is based on What if…: The hip-hop industry’a attention was brought to this track particularly because of the presence of R  Diggs and R  Jones from the legendary Wu-Tang Clan in the credits  Interestingly J-Hope also has their song ‘Shimmy Shimmy Ya’ sampled for ‘What if…’  Lyrically, it’s a sharp breakage of J-Hope’s many fears  He talks to his own self as two different entities questioning the other’s existence and his desperation to be in the game Safety Zone: The most surprising one on the album, J-Hope once again lays himself bare with his inner thoughts of having no home to call his own while also having the privilege of being a star  In a life that’s a paradox, he wonders if there really is any ‘Safety Zone’ of his own Future: Much like the title, the artist raps of his many wants and haves  He counts the numerous steps that took to be where he is today and looks at the scary future lying ahead of him  It seems to be an almost acceptance of the struggles that he has so far chanted over the course of the album Arson: The title track for ‘Jack In The Box’, J-Hope recounts the many aspects of being himself and letting go of any inhibitions by burning them as a celebration of his glory  While the fire he lit to keep himself going has turned to an ‘Arson’, he wonders if he should keep going or stop Ahead of his monumental performance at the Lollapalooza music festival, we walked with J-Hope, through his many facades that he has to keep up for survival and his real self that wants nothing but to reveal itself  Breaking away from the expectations of a K-pop idol and putting himself to a test, J-Hope has hit quite the challenge for himself with this release  ‘Jack In The Box’ is brave and nerve-wracking but applaud worthy at the same time Join the biggest

In August 2019, Bangtan TV had shared a Bangtan Bomb on its YouTube channel of the members relaxing in their dressing room at one of their shows. The video was also shared by Bangtan Subs on YouTube. In the video, BTS' J-Hope was seen at first stretching Jimin's leg who sat on a couch listening to music. Jungkook who walked about the room talked about his food and said, \"It's not medium rare, what? Isn't this just rare? Why isn't it slicing through?\" As Jungkook continued complaining about his meal, J-Hope was seen asking Jimin for both his legs. He then pretended to be on an elliptical trainer and started exercising leaving Jimin in splits. On the other hand, Jungkook again said, \"It's really rare, I can't cut through it. J-Hope who too couldn't control his laughter said, \"Ah, it feels like I'm warming up.\" Jimin then said, \"Ah, so fun.\" An unperturbed Jungkook said, \"It's not slicing through. There's so much fat though. The oil. It's really so rare?\" As J-Hope walked away, he said, \"Ah, I'm completely awake now. Jimin said, \"I'm J-Hope's pick-me-up.\" A giggling J-Hope returned to Jimin who told him to start working out again. As he lifted his legs, Jimin said, \"This will definitely wake you up\" and asked J-Hope to work on his chest. J-Hope agreed, \"Okay, I'm going for the shoulders.\" He sat on the floor, with his back at Jimin, and started lifting Jimin's legs above his shoulders. The duo burst out laughing.\" Even as the video came to an end, an irritated Junkook kept complaining, \"What is this? This is just an entire chunk of fat? The fork doesn't even go into it. It's tough to even tear it.\" Taking to the comments section, fans said that they found the video hilarious. A person wrote, \"Jimin and J-Hope: Weirdly exercising. JK in the back: Talking about steak.\" Another person wrote, \"While Hobi and Jimin are all giggly and goofing around, Jungkook is complaining that his steak is rare and has lots of fat.\" Another fan said, \"Jimin's out here literally flexing his flexibility on us. And poor JK, all he wanted was a decent steak.\" A person also wrote, \"It's hilarious hearing Jungkook talking about steak the whole time J-Hope and Jimin is fooling around with exercise. Give our precious maknae good steak please!\" \"Can we just talk about Jungkook’s steak crisis in the background? He really just went damn,\" said another fan. BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook, have travelled across the world for their concerts. In November last year, the group had travelled to Los Angeles, US, for their four in-person concerts. Following that, they took an 'extended period of rest'. After returning to South Korea, RM, Jin, Suga, and Jimin contracted the coronavirus and also recovered. Jimin also underwent acute appendicitis surgery. The members regularly share posts on Instagram and Weverse keeping fans updated about their lives.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

So, ever since BTS announced a hiatus, there has been a lot of content available for the BTS ARMY to watch. Since the boy band is of seven members, there are 7 different types of content dropping almost every other day. And now, just a couple of hours ago, Jungkook's Time Difference production film was dropped on Bangtan TV. In the Time Difference production film, Jungkook discusses what went behind the theme and the thought process of the Photo Folio So, a couple of weeks ago, when the new BTS Chapter had been unfolding, they have been sharing projects they have worked on individually. So, Jungkook worked on a Photo Folio called Time Difference. BTS member Jungkook made a special 8-photo folio. He reveals he has never worked on such a thing before. And as usual, Jungkookie was a little shy at attempting something new. However, he put his heart and soul into it, like always. He was awkward and felt that he could be more focused. In the video, Jungkook was seen discussing the theme with the staff members at HYBE As the pictures suggest, Jungkook seems to have a get-up of a vampire. Jungkook's pictures are trending big time in Hollywood news. He revealed writing down 'vampire' for a concept shoot once. Next, we see Jungkook making sketches of his outfits and discussing what fabrics and designs he wants for his Vampire-look. From frills, leather, boots and more,  Jungkook seemed very invested and particular about the look he wanted to create and bring out. JK revealed that they haven't done conceptual photoshoots before and hence, he was very satisfied while working on this one. The pictures, gradually start turning darker and Jungkook described it as the process of soul darkening. So much thought he put into creating 8 visual pieces. No wonder, he is considered Golden Maknae Meanwhile, talking about Jungkook's solo projects, he collaborated with Charlie Puth on a single called Left and Right.

The vocalist flaunted his friendship tattoo by posing shirtless. BTS ARMY went into a frenzy as Kim Seokjin is known to be a shy person. Jin stans could not control themselves on social media, and there was utter chaos after that thirst trap. After flaunting his hot avatar, Kim Seokjin aka Jin has gone back to being adorable. From pics at the pic to posing against the gorgeous beaches of Jeju Island, he is winning us over. It is a known fact that Jin aka Kim Seokjin loves to eat His recent pic was of his eating what looked like a long roll. Fans were confused with what was the dish. Korean ARMY informed others that it was a Galchi which in English is a hairtail fish. It is one of the longest fishes found in Asia and is loved by Koreans. In India, it is called Karli Fish. Some desi BTS fans confused it with dosa. Just check out some of the funny tweets here In the pic, we can see him with a cute smile on his face.

                        BTS member Kim Seokjin aka Jin has the capacity to create diverse content. This has come through so brilliantly in the past few days. From making traditional Korean alcohol with chef Baek Dong Won, to entertaining fans on the Youngji show, he is too multi-talented. Some days back, we saw the Sea of Jin concept pictures. Today, Bangtan TV has shared a video of Jin's fishing trip with Bumzu. He is a music producer with Big Hit Music. Bumzu also works a lot with the group SEVENTEEN. In the video, we can see BTS vocalist Jin aka Kim Seokjin dressed in overalls, a grey shirt and life jacket We know that BTS member Jin is fond of fishing. In the video, we can see that he has caught a fish. It is indeed a bluefin tuna that takes the bait. The fish is not very common in the Korean waters. One can find it in the sea near Jeju Island. Jin's happiness on catching the fish is boundless. Take a look BTS member Jin aka Kim Seokjin will be the first to head to the Korean military. He will soon turn 31. ARMY is very worried as he will head to the front line in the freezing winters of Korea. Jungkook is also getting back home to Korea from Qatar       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

This has started from May 2022 when some leaked pics from a trip to Jeju Island made their way to social media. Since then, fans of both groups are tracking the celebs from top to toe. The fact that #Taennie could be real intensified after matching accessories and pics with similar backgrounds surfaced frequently. Now, Korean media has reported that V was one of the celeb guests at a listening party held by BLACKPINK at a private venue on September 14, 2022. The first report came out in the leading channel, JTBC They have said that BLACKPINK held a private party for their new album, Born Pink at a private venue in Seoul's Seongsu district.

They did not allow managers as well. It seems BTS V also attended the party. This was the first time the alleged couple were in a public setting. Given the huge crowd, Kim Taehyung kept his distance from Jennie Kim. But they enjoyed the party and exchanged pleasantries in front of other guests. The channel, JTBC called up both YG Entertainment and HYBE to know about the event. One of them said they did not know about the bash J-Hope had also held a listening party for Jack In The Box. After that, he has been linked to Irene Kim, a model who is his long-time friend. The whole album Born Pink has been released today. People are loving songs like Yeah Yeah Yeah, Tally and Happiest Girl. The sound and vibe is totally different from what we have heard from Blackpink before. BTS and Blackpink fans are still confused if the two idols are really dating or not. But they do not owe anyone any explanation       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

The whole thing got rather disgusting with a spate of leaked pics that were allegedly hacked from the phone of the Blackpink star. There was no confirmation on the dating rumors from Big Hit Music or YG Entertainment. The latter however hinted at a breach of privacy. The rumours also sparked off toxic fights between BTS fans and Blackpink stans on social media. Jennie Kim's dating history was dissected, and even GD Dragon, Jimin and Bang PD names were dragged into the whole mess The whole thing does not look like it will end soon. Of late, there are many tweets from rival fans blatantly body-shaming the two idols. As we know, Kim Taehyung aka BTS V is hailed as one of the world's Most Handsome Men while Jennie Kim of Blackpink is termed as desirable by many magazine and polls. Both are music superstars and global icons in their own right. It looks like the whole thing started after Jennie Kim's latest advertisement pics that got millions of likes. She was seen posing in Calvin Klein underwear. Take a look at the tweets Well, some ARMYs are clearly not impressed. As we know, body-shaming can be very damaging. The K-Pop scene is under a lot of scrutiny for how skinny most of the idols are. Genuine music fans told people to focus on the songs instead of going there We can see that the comments are quite disparaging. Blackpink and Jennie Kim are now in the US while Kim Taehyung of BTS is planning on his debut album. He might also travel to Mexico for a variety show as per rumours       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

A fan inspired by V wrote, \"It’s always been my dream to go to a jazz club, but I’ve always felt embarrassed to go since I’m so young and it’s always filled with older people. This video of Tae gives me some confidence, that maybe I should go and not care about what others will think of me.\" Another person tweeted, \"He looks so handsome!!\" \"His outfit really suits to the jazz vibe! I mean Taehyung is the man who gonna dance with/without partner cuz he wants to enjoy and fulfill his every moment beautifully smoothly. His smile and love for every rare collection is something we really love to admire or rare to find,\" said a fan. \"Helppp why does this seem like a scene out of a movie,\" asked a fan. Another person wrote, \"It’s giving main romantic interest vibes, you’re just chilling at a snazzy bar and suddenly you’re distracted by the handsome young man grooving by himself. I live for this.\" \"Kim Taehyung vibing to Fly Me to the Moon dressed like this??? Oh I'm going feral,\" said a person. \"Y’all know that classic vintage edit of Taehyung being an old love that you’ll tell to your kids? this new video of him dancing to jazz smiling so softly has the same energy,\" wrote a fan.

                               BTS member and eldest hyung Kim Seokjin aka Jin was the guest for the finale at Youngji's show. The programme is special as guests have to binge drink along with the host. Jin aka Kim Seokjin enjoys variety shows immensely. On the show, he was his honest and funny self. Dressed in a tee and denims, he looked great with his permed hair. BTS member Jin aka Kim Seokjin who will head to the military soon for his mandatory service said that he has very few friends. He said that he has less than 10 celeb friends in his contact directory on the phone. He said most people felt that BTS were superstars, and got pressured at the thought of befriending them Jin also revealed that very few things hold his interest in life than BTS, his fans and himself. When the host thanked him for his contribution towards spreading Korean culture, he said that his members had a greater role to play than him. Just how humble he is. Jin told the host that she would beat him at the drinking game easily. The whole episode is super cute and Jin just radiates that goofy BFF energy BTS aka the Bangtan Boys announced that Jin would be enlisting by the end of 2022, or early 2023.

And since then, every year, the Bangtan Boys have been celebrating their debut anniversary with BTS ARMY, their fans. There are some readily available and some exclusive content such as BTS Festa ARMY ZIP available for them to enjoy. And today, as a part of our BTS throwback, we will be having a dekko at the 5th Festa's ARMY ZIP wherein the BTS members were all dressed as princes Suga aka Min Yoongi is one of the eldest members of BTS. Jungkook, on the other hand, is the youngest member of the group. When it was time for the boys to give messages to each other as a part of their shoot for ARMY ZIP for Festa, they all turned goofy and made it a very ROFL affair. They joked and passed confusing comments just for fun. When it was Jungkook aka the Golden Maknae's turn, Suga wished him good luck on hitting puberty. Jungkook got shy after listening to his hyung's comment. He bowed down and laughed over the same Talking about the other BTS members’ comments about Jungkook, BTS V aka Kim Taehyung took revenge on him for kissing him on the cheeks. Taetae kissed him on the cheeks back. Jin, on the other hand, playfully joked that should lose his muscles. RM complimented him saying that he really liked his muscles. Jimin said that he looked very young in the photoshoot, so he was very happy. Jungkook usually, towers over him. Hobi said that he really liked his song and someone in the background crooned Magic Shop. RM added to Suga’s puberty comment saying that he will cheer on him. Jungkook couldn’t stop blushing over it. Last but not the least, Suga sang the lines of Magic Shop for him which cracked him up in laughter Well, everyone knows Jungkook was quite young when he debuted.

The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed them recall how they interacted with fans on camera after they debuted with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook in 2013. The video started with BTS' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, \"You've to straighten your arms.\" He replied, \"I can't go any higher because of the jacket. Here's the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him).\" As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, \"Now we only have one last shooting left.\" V peered over his shoulder and asked what he was doing and if he was having fun. Jimin responded by laughing, \"It's what we used to do when we debuted. We used to do this a lot when we debuted. We'd get greedy and want to show more for our fans.\" Jimin then added, \"We are talking now.\" Pointing at V, he said, \"He used to do this a lot.\" V added, \"It's true that I used to say things like that.\" The video ended with Jimin and V talking in 'sim' language, as the caption read, all the while laughing and pulling each other's legs. All the BTS members, who are on an 'extended period of rest', are gearing up for their upcoming concerts in Seoul next month. This will be BTS' first show for th live audience in Seoul since the coronavirus pandemic began. The concerts, Permission to Dance on Stage-Seoul, will take place at Seoul's Olympic Stadium on March 10, 12 and 13, and will also be live-streamed, the group's agency Bit Hit Music had said. Their last concert for South Korean fans was in October 2019, a couple of months before the coronavirus began. As the pandemic spread in 2020, the band postponed and then called off their international tour involving nearly 40 concerts. They held some online shows instead. BTS debuted in 2013 and have produced many songs over the years. In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards. They played their first in-person concerts since the onset of the pandemic in November, in Los Angles. The pandemic also affected a few members--RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin and V, as they contracted the coronavirus. However, all of them have fully recovered.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

The former is in Qatar where he will be performing at the Al Bayt Stadium for the opening of the FIFA World Cup 2022. His presence is creating some controversy as Dua Lipa has opted out saying that she does not support the restrictions on the LGBT community. ICYMI, homosexuality is considered to be criminal offence in Qatar. The officials have said that while the LGBTQ community is welcome, they cannot campaign like holding pride flags and so on. There are rumors that even Shakira might skip the opening ceremony of the World Cup 2022 due to some personal issues. This means that BTS Jungkook will be one of the biggest acts for the day. He has already gone there for rehearsals and recording his parts for the tournament As we know, the Run BTS choreography is going viral everywhere. Jungkook has done a cute version of it and shared on his Insta stories. He is seen in black baggy pants and a white shirt.

So, when we were working on the album, I told them I wanted to include something where I could speak my mind to the others  What came out of that process was Run BTS, and I wanted to give a shout-out in it to the other members \"When asked if he shouldn't get a shout-out too for his journey, J-Hope said, \"I have been through a lot, but I think I might be the one who gets the most enjoyment out of what BTS does  Because, through BTS, I can experience things that I would have questioned whether or not I could accomplish alone \" The K-pop star also said about their album Proof, \"It was the right time to show people who recently became ARMY how we got to where we are today and show all the topics we’ve dealt with all in one place  And we think that it will also be an album that stirs up deep emotions for ARMY who have been with us from the beginning  Our timeline is basically ARMY’s timeline  We made this an album for ARMY who have taken this journey with us, one they would likely cherish, so we had a lot of fun revisiting old memories while making it \"J-Hope is all set to mark another 'memorable chapter' in his music career, as he will headline the Lollapalooza festival, becoming the first South Korean artist to do so  Lollapalooza festival will be held at Chicago's Grant Park from July 28 to July 31  K-pop group Tomorrow X Together (TXT) are due to perform on Saturday, July 30, while J-Hope will headline on Sunday, July 31  Lollapalooza said about J-Hope's performance, \"His performance will make history, cementing him as the first South Korean artist to headline the main stage at a major U S  music festival \"       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Taking to their Twitter account @BTS_twt, the group posted photos as they posed with the eldest member. In the picture, Jin wore a grey T-shirt, matching pants, and a long black jacket. He also wore a cap and white sneakers. All the members stood with him as they posed for the pictures. In the second photo, the members placed their hands on Jin's head, which he recently clean shaved for joining the military. Sharing the pictures, the members wrote, \"My brother!! Come back safely!! Love you.\" They also added purple heart emojis. Earlier, the members also shared posts on their respective Instagram accounts as they bid Jin goodbye. J-Hope shared a string of pictures featuring himself and Jin as they had a meal. The duo also posed for pictures. The photos also gave a close look at the dishes, which J-Hope said that Jin prepared. He captioned the post, \"Let's be healthy and happy bro!!! I love you!!! #Prepared by Seokjin hyung #happy dinner.\" Taking to his Instagram Stories, V dropped a clip from one of their concerts. The video featured him and Jin on the stage. He wrote, \"123 let's not get hurt.\" V also added Jin's recent release, Astronaut, as the background music. Jin's brother Kim Seok-joong took to Instagram and shared a picture of a purple banner hung on the roadside. The message, in Korean, was for Jin. He wrote, \"Good bye.\" Seok-joong geo-tagged the location as Yeoncheon. The area is where frontline troops are deployed on guard against North Korea, as per news agency Reuters. After five weeks' training at the camp, Jin will be deployed to a unit that has not yet been specified. BTS' management, BigHit Music, had said there would be no official event and asked fans to avoid travelling to the boot camp, citing safety concerns.

In an interview, the group members spoke about an ability they would want to acquire this year, a question that provokes them, an alternate profession, among other questions. In a video shared by Vogue Korea on YouTube, Jimin was asked about the words that impressed him the most in 2021. Replying to this, he said, “I remember the words, 'It's how it is'. Since the pandemic continues, lots of people are suffering and each person has different hardships and situations. I also went through some difficult times. I wanted to perform and met our fans too. So there was a time when I felt isolated. As time passed, I began to empathize with and felt the pain of the words, 'It's how it is'.” In the special edition interview, Jungkook was asked about the words that he wants to hear the most in 2022. He responded, \"Since there's no one who doesn't like compliments. I guess 'cool' would be the best. 'Cool' could be interpreted in various ways. It could mean the personality's cool or the performance on the stage is cool or the voice is cool. It can explain a lot of things, so I like the words, 'So cool'. So in 2022, I hope to hear such a word.\" BTS' V was asked if he could obtain a new ability this year, what would he choose. He replied, “Besides music and dance, I want to get the ability to play the instruments well. When it comes to instruments, one has to invest lots of time into the songs they want to play and in the end, they can feel a huge sense of accomplishment. But, I don't know how to play instruments. I used to play the saxophone often back then, but I found out that it was too hard to play all the songs I love with just saxophone. So, whether it's trumpet, clarinet or violin, I'd like to play all the songs I like, so I assume I'd choose instruments.” Next, J-Hope was asked what is the thing he has always been better at than others. He said, \"When I meet people, I think I'm good at absorbing them. Whoever I meet, I tend to try to go along with them, and I kind of absorb things like a sponge. That would be what I'd call 'a thing I'm better at than others'.\" Jin was asked what profession would he want to choose, if not his current one. He answered, \"If I were to do something else as a profession, even though I don't sell stuff, I like to recommend things I got to friends around me. I haven't recommended anything to my members, but I think I'd like to work as a person who persuades that 'This is way better', so buy this one instead. A job of persuading that a certain product is better than others.\" Suga was asked that if he were asked a question that provokes him the most, what would it be. \"A question that provokes me? 'What can you accomplish if you're so lazy like that? What would you do with such laziness?' I think this kind of question quite provokes me. I do tend to try hard to live diligently and busily, but I'm still not satisfied, so I split my time even more. I hope to become a more diligent person, so those questions would provoke me.\" Lastly, BTS leader RM was asked if he was mentioned in the textbook 50 years later, what sentence he would like there. He said, \"If I'm to be included just 'There was this kind of person among K-pop idols'. I hope to be written as one of those 'examples'. A very unique person who loved music, worked hard and challenged on things. Just like that, I guess? If I were to be in the textbook, I think I should be an outliner.\" He concluded by saying, \"We're already in the textbook, so it's fine.\" Last year, BTS members had travelled to the US for four Los Angeles in-person concerts. They returned to South Korea in December. After that, BTS announced that they will be taking an 'extended period of rest', their first since 2019.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

As per translation by a fan page, Jin said, \"I never expected to hear this at our concerts,\" while Jungkook asked, 'It's real, is it real?\" Fans, who were also present at the concert, revealed on social media that the interaction gave them goosebumps. One said, \"I was there too, it gave me goosebumps. Definitely a day to be added to history! Love my babies, so happy and proud of them.\" Another commented, \"I was there that night. It was awesome.\" Other fans on social media also praised fanboys in BTS ARMY, with one writing, \"The respect for fanboys increased a lot for me ......you made our boys happy that's all matters thank you for your existence.\" Another said, \"Who says ARMYS are young girls? So proud of our male ARMYS.\" The band has returned to Seoul after the Las Vegas concerts and is planning to release a new album in June this year.

Reports about the members- RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in talks for a free-of-charge concert were also doing rounds on the internet. This will be their first concert in their homeland after they announced their hiatus to focus on their solo career. Previously in March, they had performed the BTS PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE in Seoul. Referring to the Busan concert which will take place in October, one of the death threats read, “The October concert is free and is a nice change to get rid of Taehyung (Kim Taehyung aka V) from Jikook lives.” Reacting to the posts, fans took to Twitter and urged BTS’ agency HYBE to take necessary action. A fan wrote, “Taehyung & jimin are receiving an huge amount of D£4TH THR€4T$ lately and no one is talking about it except those people who saw the threads regarding this.” “Just reported such malicious post yesterday!! @HYBEOFFICIALtwt THIS IS IS GETTING OUT OF HANDS!! PLEASE TAKE ACTION AGAINST SUCH PESTS WHO THREAT THE SAFETY OF OUR BOYS!! WE CONDEMN THIS BEHAVIOUR,” added another one. “We demand that legal action be taken immediately for the death threats against Kim Taehyung,” commented someone else. Meanwhile, HYBE or its subsidiary music label BIGHIT MUSIC have not yet responded to the fans. Both of them manage BTS and are often seen sharing updates about taking strict legal actions against violation of the artists’ right. In late June, Big Hit said in a statement, “Our company regularly initiates legal proceedings against perpetrators of malicious activities related to BTS, including defamation, personal attacks, sexual harassment, the spread of groundless information, and ill-intentioned criticism. We would like to provide an update on these activities.” “We have recently filed additional criminal complaints against postings with personal attacks and defamation using new information provided by fans as well as collected through our monitoring initiatives,” further quoted Soompi.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

new BANGTAN BOMB shows the members of the group accompanying the oldest Jin to the site of his military enlistment and the visuals have brought tears to the eyes of the fans who are not ready to believe that this will happen six more times  Being the first from the group to enlist, Jin had the presence of all members from BTS at the Yeoncheon base camp in Gyeonggi-do \n",

      "The latest video from the group shows the BTS members gathering to have their one last moment with Jin before he is off for his basic military training  One by one they can be seen huddling around the oldest and cracking jokes in their usual fashion about his new hairstyle, a buzzcut  They all rush to touch his shortened hair and make fun of it being a &ldquo;dragon ball that can fulfil their wish&rdquo;  It is indeed Jin&rsquo;s handsome face that can rock any haircut and BTS approves \n",

      "They all take one group pic, which definitely left their fans emotional as they touched his head and commemorated him being the first to enlist  Individual photos later it was time for Jin to go as he hurried in, doing a salute immediately  Many noted the unreadable expressions on the faces of the rest of BTS as they saw him leave  Jin spoke about keeping healthy and returning soon and asked the same of ARMY  Leader RM took to the camera saying how though they are sad to see him leave, the others will follow suit soon hinting at the members&rsquo; upcoming enlistment \n",

Jungkook has been quite active on Instagram until now and this update on Twitter has come as a shock for the BTS ARMY. Jungkook dropped a hazy, blurry picture of himself on Big Hit's official Twitter handle for BTS. It's an extreme close-up of his face. ARMY is shocked beyond words after looking at JK in that avatar Talking about Jungkook's picture that HYBE dropped on Twitter, JK has long hair, red eyes, and reddish lips. He has a ruffled collar shirt as well. The eyebrow piercing is also being noticed by the ARMY. All in all, Jungkook is giving out the vibes of some novella. ARMY has called him a vampire due to his look in the picture. The caption of the tweet says, \"Me, Myself, and Jung Kook.\" There are hashtags Photo Folio and Editor JK. Folio usually consists of a collection of drawings, documents, etc. that represent a person's, especially an artist's, work and it seems Jungkook has been the editor for the image as well. BTS is always the biggest trend in Hollywood news Though a blurry picture, BTS ARMY is going crazy over how hot Jungkook looks. It's especially his red eyes, red lips and white skin which is giving out a vampire kind of effect to Jungkook. He has indeed opened a thirst trap for the ARMY on Twitter. They are going berserk BTS Jungkook worked with Charlie Puth on a single called Left and Right. Furthermore, he also worked on a single, Bad Decisions by Benny Blanco and Snoop Dogg alongside the rest of the vocal line of BTS - Jin (Kim Seokjin), Jimin (Park Jimin) and V (Kim Taehyung). Well, we'll do our fair share of guesswork here and we may be wrong too. As y'all know,  BTS has been actively involved in the making of Webtoon 7 Fates: Chakho. It's returning soon. Could this be Zeha's look? Or it might be a hint at Jungkook's solo project and if that is so, then something major is coming up!       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

Jungkook danced with Hobi and Taehyung. RM socialised a lot and Jin was very shy around everyone. Jimin, who was pretty excited about the party, was seen enjoying themself with the Taehyung and others. However, Jungkook and Hobi stole the show.

And just a couple of hours ago, Jin came live on Weverse in honour of The Astronaut's release. It was a fun and an interesting live wherein he watched, reviewed and also shared some insight into the making of The Astronaut MV. From talking about working on lyrics of the song with Chris Martin, Coldplay's front runner, to his military enlistment, Jin poured his heart out in front of the ARMYs. In his Weverse live, Jin revealed that they did not make the announcement of BTS' military enlistment decision before the concert On 15th October, the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook – held a Yet To Come Busan concert. Two days later on 17th October, Big Hit Music announced that the BTS members have decided to enlist in the military. It was a huge shock! Jin is the first member who will enlist in the military from BTS. Mr Worldwide Handsome Jin talked about his military enlistment in the live and made a shocking revelation. This is going to blow up Hollywood News During his Weverse live, as per an ARMY translating live on Twitter, Kim Seokjin aka Jin revealed that they did not make the military enlistment announcement before the Yet To Come Busan concert because they wanted the ARMYs to be happy at the concert and enjoy it thoroughly. Jin said that he is glad that they didn't see ARMYs in tears at the concert. Jin revealed that he and the members had been having differences in when to enlist in the military. Jin said that he was planning to enlist in Summer, around in June. He also shared that he had no plans to drop any album as he had not spoken to Chris back then In the live, Jin also said that talking about military enlistment was more like a Voldemort-like word for him. However, he is relieved now that he has gotten it out of his system. In the Harry Potter franchise, Voldemort was a person who could not be named.

such that there is no doubt that the K-Pop band is by far not only one of the most popular music groups in today's time, but also among the most iconic of all time, with Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, Jungkook, V, Suga and RM (those are the BTS members for the uninitiated) enjoying fame, fans and impact that cuts across every ethnic, cultural and geographical demographic known to us. So, it comes as no surprise that ARMY (that's what BTS fans the world over refer to themselves as) can't get enough of BTS and make it a point to keep up to date with every little development about the group So, if you consider yourself one amongst ARMY, then this latest BTS news should be right up your alley. For those of you curious about the upcoming BTS album, Proof, here's a red-hot BTS update just for you that you simply can't miss out on. Now, since Proof is an anthology album, with all BTS members selecting a mix of their favourite BTS songs as well as individual tracks, J-Hope has finally revealed why he chose the songs, Her and Ego to be a part of BTS' Proof album “There may be many predictions but there are times when I have to wear a mask to hide the sides of myself that I don’t particularly want to show other people and I sometimes hide because I didn’t want to show that side of myself either. But they are all me. I came to accept all of my sides as part of my identity, my ego because my members and ARMY accept all of me. Who I am and the way I am, is my ego and that is my Proof,” J-Hope said in a clip shared by Big Hit Music BTS Proof is slated to release on 10th June       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

vehicle on 6 June 2021 as a gift to his fans in celebration of BTS’ then-upcoming 8 year anniversary and the ongoing FESTA which is a yearly commemoration of the group’s debut June 3 is celebrated as World Bicycle Day and we think who better than the man and his song to celebrate it with ‘Bicycle’, is about to turn a year old soon and the song continues to be a slow pat on the head with its rhythmic beats and slow hums that are enough to lull you into a blissfully calm cluster of moments  The number presents itself as just that, a collection of the songwriter’s feelings as he maneuvers through the many turns of his life, characteristically placing his K-pop idol life under the microscope He talks about the moment of liberation on placing his two feet on the pedals, the one that also brings him despair over the many happenings of his life and longing for freedom as the pandemic came to be  The post-chorus is a string of “Na Na”, delivering the humming nature of his ride every time he drives around the town “슬프면 자전거를 타자” is how he begins the chorus, which translates to “If you are sad, let's ride a bicycle”  It signifies his go-to activity when he feels low is bicycle riding  He further adds to his unbinding moments by choosing to talk about the miracle that is now achievable, a midday dream come true RM and co-writer John Eun’s comparison of the bike ride to precious invisible things as one dances with the wind, looking like a bird, is relatable and takes you right back to a moment of unchained existence as the two wheels roll on a paved road Just as the singer wishes for the song to be a companion on the listener’s ride, we hope you can add it to your playlist after listening to it https://www youtube com/embed/6uq3P7zeYyUJoin the biggest community of K-Pop

singer, member J-Hope is the all rounder we’ve always been looking for  His charisma surpasses any set expectations and extends to a level with a deserved appreciation for his artistry Known to run along a flow unrivaled by most others in the industry, the often rule-abiding member turns into a heart machine around his fans  Not afraid to expose his mushy side, plenty have admitted to being floored by his duality  On the other hand, his personality as Hoseok (J-Hope’s real name) is one full of undeniable stage presence  A fashion King with both his avatars, we are enamored by his talents

BTS’ agencies HYBE and BigHit refused to comment on the matter, which further raised speculations. In the latest, pictures from V’s trip to New York, he was spotted wearing a a similar to one which Jennie wore in leaked photos. Amid all the speculations, Korean news portal JTBC reported about V attending Blackpink’s private party. As per the report, the party was held at a cultural complex in Seongsu-dong, Seoul on September 14 with tight security. The event was attended by several stars from the Korean entertainment industry, ranging from actors to singers and more. V not only marked his presence at the event but also stayed for quite some time while Blackpink members--Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa attended the guests. The private party was reportedly only meant for A-listers and even managers of celebrities weren’t allowed to enter. While both the group’s agency, HYBE and YG Entertainment didn’t confirm the developments of the report, one reportedly denied even knowing about any such private event.

      "As an idol, he is extremely talented and there is no doubt in that but besides his blinding talents, he is also known to be an extremely helpful and considerate person in the group and as an individual  He constantly creates music that fits the palette of the members as well as the fans and makes sure his group is doing well during promotional events, live or even concerts  Being the oldest, he shoulders all the problems of the younger ones and with the added pressure of being the leader, he takes on additional responsibilities as well &nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "He also cares for his fans and constantly listens to their problems, jokes and requests during the constant lives he does called &lsquo;Chan&rsquo;s Room&rsquo; where he basically reacts and gives his opinion on songs created by other artists, give advice on various topics and basically act as a source of comfort for many STAYs and he does this just out of his love for the fans  Many idols love their fans but Bangchan really puts in a lot of effort for them as well as his members and as he turns 25, we hope to see more of Bangchan even if he is 75!\n",

Talking about the BTS X Grammy performance, it was one of the biggest highlights of the evening. And now, the Bangtan TV has dropped a behind of the BTS' Grammy 2022 performance on Butter from which there are some of the moments of V aka Kim Taehyung, that ARMY cannot stop talking about Yes, the clip of BTS V aka Kim Taehyung giving money to Suga aka Min Yoongi is included in the video.

V is heard saying that he was the first person in front of his eyes and felt like giving the money to him So, the Bangtan Boys, RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook performed together just twice, it seems. Other times, they would rehearse without either one or two members. Jin, unfortunately, had to sit out due to his injury. Hobi joined in late and the group had to focus on getting the sync right. When Taehyung struggled with the jacket choreo, the Golden Maknae aka Jungkook was seen helping him out. There's also a clip in which Taehyung talks about when he'll throw the card at Jungkook and he actually had the technicalities in his mind. ARMYs were bowled over with the same After the rehearsals, all the members thanked the dancers who danced with them during the rehearsals. BTS V aka Kim Taehyung was seen moving ahead and thanking them loudly and acknowledging them for their hard work There's a moment when he is seen discussing the camera angles with the boys. His adorable puppy eyes have grabbed the attention of the ARMYs. Apart from that, the Taehyung bias ARMY cannot stop gushing over his bread cheeks and eyes After their final performance, BTS members were seen reviewing their performance in the room. Taehyung, Jin and Jimin are seen watching the clip during of his interaction with Olivia Rodrigo. He confirms right after the performance that he whispered 'blah blah' to her in her ears during their Butter performance.

YG Entertainment has revealed the teaser of the music video of Shut Down. The full song will be out on September 16, 2022. In the video, we can see Rose, Jennie, Jisoo and Lisa. The first two girls are shown a little more prominently. This is the second song after Pink Venom. The teaser hooks you on because the sound of the song is totally different from what has been coming out from the stable of YG Entertainment. The last song, Pink Venom got some flak for being too repetitive. Music producer Teddy bore the brunt of the same. But Blinks have declared this one as the Song Of The Year Blackpink members have been in the news and how. Everyone was waiting for their comeback with bated breath. The girls will soon go on a world tour. Fans are waiting for the date announcements. Jisoo, Jennie and Lisa have all made immense news last year. Jisoo made her acting debut with Snowdrop with Jung Hae-In. The show was a controversial one but people liked Jisoo's screen presence and performance. But Lisa overshadowed them with her record-breaking single Lalisa. She also won the Best K-Pop soloist at the MTV VMAS 2022. Lisa was seen with Celina brand ambassadors at main events. Take a look at some of the reactions for the MV Teaser Jennie Kim's rap in Pink Venom was unanimously liked by music critics.

The lyrics read, \"Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight.\" In the tweet, Delhi airport also added a purple heart, which is a representation of the love between BTS and its fans, along with the hashtags #BTSArmy #BTS #AirportTwitter.\" The tweet soon went viral, with many fans asking if their numerous requests made Delhi airport join the trend. Meanwhile, some fans tagged other airports in India, asking them to join the BTS ARMY. Some believed the tweet means that BTS will make a stop in Delhi as well during their rumoured world tour. One wrote, \"This is happening!!!\" while another commented, \"Wow.....I am just waiting for when BTS comes to India.\" Other fans asked for a confirmation if the band is coming to Delhi, so that they could start saving money. One asked, “Delhi airport????!!!!! Oh my god I'm coming I'm saving up all on money. Also helllo @bts_bighit, while another commented, ”@BIGHIT_MUSIC please deny this ASAP I need to start saving money.\" A third one wrote, \"Omg I am going to rob the bank ...I am coming soon babies.\" Another concerned fan asked, \"WTF is happening. BTS flights or tour? I'm not ready. I'm broke bro. Tell me I've to prepare my organs.\" According to some fans, the ongoing phenomenon on Twitter is just a trend that started when Orlando airport tweeted a line from BTS leader RM's song Moonchild, along with a picture of a plane in a blue sky on April 25. Other airports then started sharing pictures of purple skies, along with lyrics from BTS songs. However, the trend has left many fans confused who are hoping to see BTS live.

They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, 'You eat it all'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, 'Back to our dorm'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn't want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other's locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed 'my friend' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, \"We can go back to a place we've been already.\" He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, \"I'll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase.\" However, he got shy and couldn't ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested 'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, \" I want to try pole dancing too.\" RM added, \"That suits you though.\" The video ended with V goofily saying, \"Run BTS will continue running.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

When a fan teased Suga saying that he's getting younger, he laughed and said, \"I'm 30, I'm not that old yet.\" Speaking about the original soundtrack, Stay Alive, that he produced for the webtoon 7 Fates Chakho, Suga asked the feedback of his viewers. As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_ Yoongi spoke about both the tracks--Stay Alive and Girl of My Dreams, revealing that he wrote the lyrics for the songs on the flight to the US. He also said he recorded Girl of My Dreams almost as soon as he landed there. Suga then spoke about the lyrics of Stay Alive and also about Jungkook who sang the song. \"I wrote the lyrics for Stay Alive with keeping the webtoon in mind. Jungkook recorded the song so well. The chorus was so high but he didn't even do a re-recording, it was approved at once. He's a person overflowing with talent.\" When a fan asked if Suga was working on Stay Alive in In The Soop, he replied, \"Yes right. But at the time Jungkook's melody was not put in the song. It's the one I was working on in In The Soop.\" Suga also promised ARMY that he will hold a live session on his birthday, which is on March 9. \"It's my birthday soon, I'll see you guys on my birthday. I'll come live again on my birthday,\" he said. When asked what he planned to do on his special day, Suga replied, \"What will I do on my birthday? The day after is concert day so I don't think I can do much (laughed).\" BTS will hold three concerts in Seoul this month. The BTS Permission To Dance On Stage-Seoul is scheduled on March 10, 12 and 13. The BTS member also spoke about their home concert next week, \"The concert is going to be very fun. We're preparing hard. We've been looking forward to a concert in Korea. It will still be quite chilly in March so I'm trying not to get sick.\" About their Las Vegas concert, Suga said, \"I'm excited for the Vegas concert too, the renewed venue. The stadium itself looked so cool, we saw it while passing by.\" The dates of the concerts are April 8, 9, 15 and 16. When a fan teased him saying Bangtan (BTS) is so lucky they can go to Bangtan concert, Suga laughed and said, \"Haha, they (we) go every time.\" A fan wrote, \"If I can't go to the concert I'll die\", Suga responded laughing, \"It's not like that. You can watch it online too.\" When he asked ARMY to not get 'too nervous' during ticketing and be calm, a fan said, \"Is there a way not to get nervous (about ticketing)?\" He replied, \"Just do it as you normally would. Like when you're choosing from a menu.\" The BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook last December debuted on Instagram. Speaking about his feed, Suga said, \"I don't know what pictures to upload on Instagram. I don't know how to make my feed look pretty, either. I normally don't take pictures. I'm still not sure what this 'Instagram vibe' is all about.\" Suga who recently recovered from Covid-19, said, \"My condition is all better now. It's been like three months since I contracted it (Covid-19). People don't always catch it cause they didn't take care. No one wants to contract it on purpose. It's not your fault.\" Suga also replied when asked if his pet Holly still walks all over him, \"Yes. When I get home he comes with his clothes held in his mouth like let's go on a walk. He's sleeping right next to me every day.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

statement, the music company said Jin will begin his process as early as October end  Others will join as as and when they are asked  (Also read: South Korea passes law allowing BTS to postpone mandatory military service)BIGHIT MUSIC is proud to announce today that the members of BTS are currently moving forward with plans to fulfill their military service  After the phenomenal concert to support Busan’s bid for the World Expo 2030, and as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it’s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honored to serve Since the creation of BTS over ten years ago, the band has risen to international success, broken records, and catapulted K-Pop into the global stratosphere  BIGHIT MUSIC has focused to the milestone moment when it would be possible to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men to serve with their countrymen, and that’s now  Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October  He will then follow the enlistment procedure of the Korean government  Other members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans  Both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment With the release of their first anthology album earlier this year it opened the path to allow the members to take some time to explore individual projects  As part of the HYBE family, we support and encourage our artists and are beyond proud that they will each now have time to explore their unique interests and do their duty by being of service to the country they call home “Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)” is more than a track from their latest album, it is a promise, there’s much more yet to come in the years ahead from BTS Thank you Military service for BTS members has long been subject of debate  Some polls show a majority of South Koreans, not just the group’s dedicated fans who are known as Army, think the group’s members should be allowed exemptions from, or be offered some alternative to, military duties Military service exemptions, however, are controversial in a country where inequality and privilege are highly touchy subjects  All male citizens aged 18 to 28 are required to serve for about two years to guard against North Korea  Kim Seok-jin, BTS’ oldest member, is required to join the army after he turns 30 on Dec 4, and the second-oldest member Min Yoon-ki is due to be enlisted in 2024

Woo-shik opted for a white T-shirt under a grey jacket and paired it with matching pants. V also shared a photo as he and Woo-shik sat inside a restaurant. For the camera, Woo-shik smiled and posed with his hands on his face. V was seen tilting back and smiling. Glasses filled with beverages were kept on the table. V and Woo-shik seemingly enjoyed red and white wine. V tagged his Wooga Squad friend in the post. Taking to his Instagram Stories, Choi Woo-shik too shared a video of him playing golf. In the first post, sharing the clip, he wrote, \"Baby fade.\" In the next clip, as he hit the ball, V who was recording the video, softly said, \"Shot.\" The actor smiled as he walked away with his hand on his chest. Several people praised him saying 'nice one' and 'wow'. He also re-shared V's restaurant post on his Instagram.

As Jin held him, Chris hugged him back and also kissed him on his head. They also sang the track The Astronaut and danced together on stage. After his performance, Jin said, \"And I love you ARMY, you all\", bowed at the audience and walked out off the stage. Reacting to the clip, a fan wrote, \"What a performance. Jin is so talented. This performance will stay my favourite for a long time. The high note was amazing.\" Another fan tweeted, \"This song is not just a song, it's an emotion. I truly think this song is THE LOVE SONG for me. I was crying during watching this. AND I LOVE YOU this part hits different!!\" A Twitter user wrote, \"I love the part where Jin was running back towards Chris and he was beaming with pride waiting for Jin with his wide open arms. It’s like a big brother who’s happily welcoming his little brother. The song is beautiful and so is Jin’s voice.\" “This is not a goodbye, this is an assurance of him coming back to us soon. Words are not enough to express how much we love you, Seokjin!” tweeted a fan. This isn't the first time that BTS collaborated with Coldplay. Last year, they came together for their song My Universe. Speaking about BTS, Chris said on stage on Friday, \"About six months ago, one of their (BTS) members called me up and he said, 'I have to leave the band in December for two years and join the army in Korea because that's the rules there. I need a song that says goodbye to everybody for a little while, that tells them that I love them.\" He continued, \"Because like all bands we need you, it's you that really does everything, it's you that's the magic. and so I said, 'Ok. We'll do a song together'. Instead of being worried about it, I feel so excited about it, so grateful for this relationship we have with BTS.\" Chris also said, \"He has flown all the way here from Korea. The last time you'll see him for a couple of years, he has to go join the army, which is serious stuff. And we hope it goes ok.\" Recently, BTS agency BigHit Music announced that the members would enlist in the military, putting an end to a debate about whether they should be exempt from the mandatory service requirement of about two years. Jin, the eldest member, said he would sign up in December.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Lisa was seen jumping on the pole as she tried pole dancing twice. For the event, V opted for a white T-shirt, black pants and tied a jacket around his waist. Lisa wore a black dress and matching boots. Sharing the clip on Twitter, a fan wrote, \"Are we having a collective hallucination or... Taehyung and Lisa were trying the pole dancing at Celine after party? I’m dead, truly.\" Another person said, \"Lisa pole dancing is something I didn't know I needed.\" A tweet read, \"Never in my life would I have thought I’d see the day Lisa and Taehyung pole dancing how is this all real.\" \"Taehyung pole dancing in a Parisian underground ruin bar was not on my 2022 bingo card yet here we are,\" wrote a Twitter user. \"People got to watch the Kim Taehyung pole dance right in front of them for FREE?????\" asked a fan. Earlier, taking to his Instagram Stories, V posted a series of pictures as he goofed around near his private jet. He also posted a photo with Bo-gum as they walked near their plane. V also shared pictures as he posed near the Eiffel Towers, and later with a dog. V's travel comes a few weeks after he along with other BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook released their anthology album Proof. The new album comprised old as well as new tracks. Proof debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, making the group score their sixth chart-topper.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Apart from the earlier blue and grey outfits, the BTS members were also seen in white outfits. The clip also comprised J-Hope's mirror selfies, and pictures holding the hands of the members. In the video, J-Hope said, \"I included Her and Outro: Ego in this album, Proof. Her is essentially a love song, but some ARMY interpreted the lyrics as being more complex, about feeling the pressures of having to reshape who I am for Her. There can be many different interpretations, but there are times when I have to wear a mask to hide the sides of myself that I don't particularly want to show other people.\" He also added, \"And I sometimes hid because I didn't want to show that side of myself either. But they are all me. I came to accept all of my sides as parts of my identity, my ego, because the members and ARMY accept all of me. Who I am, just as I am, my ego is my Proof.\" Reacting to the video, a fan said, \"Yes we accept all of you as you are Hobi..yesterday, today, tomorrow & forever, just be the way you want to be! I LOVE YOU.\" \"Army loves & appreciates you for all you do & are #Proof_of_JHope #JHOPE I'm getting emotional.. beloved HER,\" tweeted a person. \"Hobi is so precious, yes Ego is so powerful #Proof_of_JHope is very Beautiful like Acceptance & the most unconditional Bond between Army + BTS (Him). Aaah same Babe same. I'm getting teary eyes #BTS_Proof is such an intimate journey,\" wrote another fan. A tweet read, \"Jung Hoseok saying how Her can be a love song but also be interpreted as a complex song of hiding aspects of ourselves and him embracing all of these sides of himself as his ego to be his proof is so beautiful!\" \"Your growth of realising how every good and downside of you is all you, inspired me a lot to feel better about myself in every persona I own. thank you for sharing with us your journey of finding yourself. I love you. and will always do,\" said a person. \"My cute hope it's your freedom to show what you want to. a beautiful relationship will always have boundaries then only it can become beautiful. I'm so glad and proud that you accept and love all sides of yourself. ARMY will always love you. Thank you for choosing Her and Ego,\" said a fan.

In another part of the video, Jin asked the members to go inside, and J-Hope replied, “Why would we go inside?” and V added, “There will be one moment like this. There won’t be another one after this.” J-Hope responded, “That’s right, this is only one time.” All the members clicked individual selfies and group photos with Jin. In a message for the BTS ARMY, Jin looked at the camera and said, \"I'll go and come back safely. Since being healthy is first priority I won't be sick, and our ARMYs, fighting and don't be sick either.\" Next, in the video, Jin ran towards a group of people standing in rows. The singer was also seen doing the salute as the people around them clapped. The video showed all the members looking at Jin as they got emotional. As the video ended, RM said, \"I'm worried about jin hyung who doesn't like the cold but his younger brothers will follow him soon. It doesn't feel great to send him off but he does well wherever he goes. I believe he'll do well. It doesn't feel good but it's something everyone has to do, so fighting hyung. Don't get hurt, be healthy, and I'll prepare well too. Fighting!\" On Thursday, Jimin also shared a note talking about Jin. The singer wrote on Weverse, \"I wonder if Jin is training.\" Jimin also changed his profile picture on Weverse to that of a selfie with Jin. Jin began his 18 months of military service at a front-line South Korean boot camp Tuesday. Jin, who turned 30 earlier this month, entered the boot camp at Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea.

We would like to inform you that the event and content below have been postponed. 12 PM, October 30 (KST) Stationhead Listening Party. 0 AM, October 31 (KST) The Astronaut Lyric Video.\" In another tweet, it added, \"The changed schedules will be announced through a separate notice. We ask for your generous understanding. Thank you.\" The announcement comes after over 150 people were killed in a stampede at a Halloween event in Seoul, as per news agency AFP. The crowd surge and crush hit in the capital's popular Itaewon district, where police estimate as many as 100,000 people -- mostly in their teens and 20s -- went to celebrate Halloween Saturday night. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared a period of national mourning on Sunday, telling the country in a televised address that \"a tragedy and disaster occurred that should not have happened\". He said the government \"will thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and make fundamental improvements to ensure the same accident does not occur again in the future\". The postponement of the listening party and The Astronaut lyric video comes after Jin's recent performance of his first-ever solo at Coldplay's concert in Argentina. This was Jin's last live performance ahead of enlisting for mandatory military service. Recently, BigHit Music said the seven members, RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook would enlist in the military. This put an end to a debate about whether they should be exempt from the mandatory service requirement of about two years. Jin, the eldest of the group, said he would sign up in December. The group has said they hope to reconvene by 2025.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

Have you been well? (For me) I'm doing well. You might've heard the news but we came to support the hosting of 2030 Busan World Expo. I'm glad to be together in the meaningful event and I think I'll be happy to see you guys in person on the date (once it's gets) scheduled.\" He also added, \"And you might already know from the photo but we all got friendship tattoos together. I wanted to show it to you while holding the mic but since my hands are smaller, it wasn't visible when I held the mic hehe... I'm uploading a photo (instead) with a sad heart. Have good dreams today.\" Jimin dropped a close-up picture of himself as he posed for the camera. The member had his index finger on the side of his nose's bridge as he smiled slightly for the photo.

Reacting to the post, a fan wrote on Twitter, \"GOSH his eyes, his lips, his hair, his golden skin, his cute finger and the little pretty seven tattoo. It's so beautiful.. even from the screen I can feel how fluffy and cosy he is.\" Another person said, \"The doe-like eyes, the small smile, the way he placed the finger on his nose bridge and his pretty little 7 everything about Jimin is so endearing to me, I'm gonna cry he's the sweetest he's so precious my baby.\" \"JIMIN finally revealing his 7 tattoo, mentioning how his fingers are tiny & how he can't wait to see ARMYs again, this is enough strength & energy for me to keep going for months,\" said a person. Earlier, eagle-eyed fans had noticed that Jimin got the tattoo on his index finger. So far RM, Jin, J-Hope, V and Jungkook have revealed that they got inked with the friendship tattoo.

He simply wrote Jimin's name and 'happy birthday' in two posts, before sharing a video which according to BTS ARMY was both sultry and hilarious at the same time. Instead of sharing a video of Jimin or saying something about him, Jungkook showed himself off in the video. He started by slowly removing his glasses, playing with his hair, and giving sultry looks at the camera for a whole minute before he whispered at the end of the video, \"Jjyaman, happy birthday, happy birthday bro.\" Interestingly, it was also his first post on Weverse since 2019. Jin also chose a somewhat similar manner to wish Jimin. Taking to Weverse, he shared a selfie that had a whole lot of him and only a glimpse of Jimin, and wrote, \"Jimin-ah Happy birthday.\" Band leader RM shared a cute picture of Jimin with his eyes closed on Instagram to wish him, while J-Hope shared a video of him and Jimin and pictures of the birthday boy from a plane on Instagram Stories to mark the day. Suga wrote in his birthday message, \"happy birthday Jiyaman...I guess you'll spend your birthday week in Busan hahahahahaha HBD!\" V also took to Instagram Stories to share a selfie of him and Jimin edited with a sketch filter. Meanwhile, Jimin came on VLIVE like every year to ring in his birthday with his fans, and cut his birthday cake while talking to ARMY. He said, \"So many of you came and I want to quickly give these flowers to you. On my birthday that isn't too special, I thankfully received an undeserved amount of congratulations from so many ARMYs. I won't forget today and will treasure it happily. I love you.\"       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

He is performing at the inaugural function along with other big musical acts. The Golden Maknae is one of the star performers of the show. He met this little girl at a mall, and her aunt shared the interaction. She said he was a sweet and humble lad. This is the best thing you will see today The girl apparently told Jungkook that she knew who he was but did not know his name. Jungkook gave a surprised reaction. This is the line he had once said in a Hollywood interview when he said he knew the face of his crush (Hollywood actress) but did not know the name Fans have been trying to make Jungkook's Qatar stay as peaceful as possible. But fans have gathered where he is shooting just to wave at him from a distance. Jungkook returned the love He was at the Vendome Mall. It seems he shopped at the Balenciaga outlet. The mall has the best brands from all over the world The pop icon made Bunny Ears on her as her aunt made a small video. Even the bodyguard was smiling. Jungkook looked adorable in the Tik Tok video The girl's aunt said her niece was on cloud nine seeing Jungkook. She wrote on Twitter, That one time you are at the mall and saw #jungkook \r\n",

BLACKPINK's Blinks and TWICE's Onces have been embroiled in a heated debate on social media ever since the Dahyun incident. It so happened that Kim Da-Hyun was doing a live with her fans when Lisa's music video, Lalisa came. As we know, it is one of the biggest K-Pop hits of 2021-22. The song is a bop and Lisa has picked up awards for the same. Da-hyun was playing songs of TWICE for fans when she skipped the music video of Lalisa that apparently came as an ad. This did not go down well with a certain section of Blackpink fandom. As per some Blinks, Da-hyun apparently lied that she did not have YT Premium account After that incident, tempers of TWICE and BLACKPINK fans rose on social media. As we know, verbal slurs on Twitter can be very derogatory and both fandoms slugged it out. Now, TWICE have written on Twitter that some Blinks cyber bullied and doxxed an admin of one of their biggest fan pages. Doxxing is leaking out someone's private information on social media with a malicious intent. This has apparently affected the health of the person who is now seeking treatment in a hospital. The hashtag #Blinkscyberbullying' is trending since early morning. Take a look at the tweets What has upset many is that the name of Jonghyun has been dragged in too. Fans know that he is a late K-Pop vocalist who died by suicide. It is one of the biggest recent tragedies in the industry. The BLACKPINK members are busy with their comeback, Pink Venom which is doing quite well       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

      "&#39;Island&#39; is a webtoon inspired K-drama brought to life thanks to a statement making ensemble, fairly impressive VFX and an immersive storyline  Here, the chaebol daughter of the famed Daeho group, Won Mi Ho, is sent off to Jeju Island for repenting for her actions  She encounters bloodthirsty demons on her way who she is unable to fight  A man intervenes with his dagger, hawk-like eyes, unbelievable speed and the urge to kill  Found to be Van, the suited man is tight-lipped and only appears when Won Mi Ho is in need of his help  As the old prophecy awakens and lust demons threaten to kill the unaware woman, a Priest named Yohan becomes curious about the happenings in South Korea and decides to return \n",

      "As he is initially introduced, Giovanni is a young boy named Kang Chan Hyeok who moved to Italy in his earlier days and returned at the age of 20 after being called upon by the pull of a prophecy  Here, he makes himself known as Priest Yohan, a popular Priest who has moved around saving humans from the wrath of spirits  His methods are none the ordinary as he channels his love for Hallyu aka the Korean wave while dealing with evil  While it may sound funny, it adds the necessary edge to Cha Eun Woo&#39;s character &nbsp;\n",
      "With a pair of headphones around his ears, RnB music blasting through it, he uses ignorance to fend off the evil  Ruthless, he charges ahead while chanting and using a crucifix to burn through the negative energies  With sneakers on his feet and a spring in his step, he manages to surprise you with each action &nbsp;\n",

      "The latest episode of &#39;Island&#39; saw Yohan bring out a pointed sword-like object and use it against Van, the character played by Kim Nam Gil, who is a half-human and half-demonic presence among them, managing to hide from everyone but the Priest who is out for his blood  The chemistry between Cha Eun Woo and Kim Nam Gil as they bicker, waiting to break out into a fight any moment, is better than we expected &nbsp;\n",

      "On the other hand, since he is known for performing exorcisms, Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s character takes on action scenes frequently and the actor worked on them with just as much enthusiasm, getting bruised while pulling them off with all his might  He spoke about the difficulties of working on the sets, &ldquo;I used my body a lot  When I was rolling over a mountain or something like that, I got some small scars and it hurt a little  I have some wounds and those bits were difficult but, I feel proud and it was fun portraying the character &rdquo;\n",

And the BTS ARMY is celebrating his special day in the most special manner. There are various birthday projects organised by the ARMYs in the name of the BTS leader. Namjoon conducted a live on Weverse a couple of minutes ago. It's a ritual amongst the BTS members to spend a couple of hours with the ARMYs and Namjoon also joined ARMYs and celebrated his birthday with them while catching up. And during RM's birthday live, another BTS member J-hope aka Jung Hoseok spammed his session, but ARMYs are enjoying it So, in Hollywood News today, RM came live to chat with the ARMYs a bit. The Weverse made a glitch because of which he had to conduct two lives. RM's birthday cake was of Moni, his pet pooch and it was very adorable. RM talked about working on his album and revealed that it's almost done. However, Namjoon is not sure when it will release. He is hoping that his album comes out by the end of the year. Kim Namjoon also shared that he has been getting a lot of help from the other Bangtan Boys for his album and added that a lot of people helped him this time. RM talked about the newly released Decision to Love, a South Korean film, Balming Tiger and a lot of other things One member to never miss anything about the other Bangtannies is J-hope. Be it the albums or the pictures and now even Live session. J-hope spammed RM's live by commenting on it. It was hilarious and adorable. When RM turned emotional while talking about how the boys' hearts beat like one and how they are all always thinking about the same stuff, J-hope commented \"7 forever!!!!!!!!!\" he commented 7 multiple times and even wished Namjoon on live saying \"HB BFF.\" When RM was distracted Hobi dropped a lot of comments to cheer him up and called himself a successful fan ARMY is loving the interaction. Jhope was at home and had been spamming the comments about Namjoon's birthday live. Talking about which, Namjoon showed a little bit of his house and also shared that members have a lot of solo projects coming up. Also, what's with RM covering himself through and through? We hope he didn't chop off his tresses       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

It came as a huge shock but was long due. For about a year there were discussions on BTS’ military enlistment, whether they should be exempted or not with a lot of people batting for the exemption. However, the boys have set yet another example by following their laws. There have been various reactions to the BTS military enlistment announcement. However, the Daily Show host Trevor Noah’s take on it will agree with a lot of BTS ARMY Well, it is true that the whole Hollywood News section is talking about the military enlistment of Bangtan Boys. So, the Daily Show host, Trevor Noah had to talk about it as well. And he had the funniest take on the same. Trevor said that everyone loves BTS and hence no ARMY would want to shoot at them. Furthermore, he added that any ARMY would gladly take bullets from the BTS. “Enemy soldiers would be like ‘Ah, I just got stabbed by Jin, this is the last and the best day of my life” to the roar of applause On Monday (yep, blame it on Monday) Big Hit Music dropped a statement revealing BTS’ decision to enlist in the mandatory service in the South Korean military. It has been reported that the eldest BTS member Kim Seokjin aka Jin had requested the same to be delayed till December 2022, but he seems to have withdrawn his request for delay. Jin is going to be the first member to begin his military enlistment producer which is by the end of the month Before leaving for military service, Jin has planned a special gift for the ARMY which is his single called The Astronaut. For the same, Jin has collaborated with Chris Martin. The logo teaser, the promotional schedule and the timeline were dropped by HYBE on Weverse last night. The Astronaut is releasing on 28th October       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

\"There's (just) a day left until our dongsaeng's (younger sibling in Korean) birthday.\" Jimin also shared a photo of all the BTS members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V and Junkook – including himself. He wrote, \"Jungkook is appearing on the TV whoa, Instagram too... The reason I haven't shown my face these days is since I gained weight but I'm dieting once again though. Please wait a little bit.\" Speaking about doing a live session for the ARMY, BTS fans, Jimin said, \"I'll do it in near future. I was just living on while trying to make music. I once again realised that our members are people who are so so good (at making music) and amazing.\" He also said, \"Our ARMY, I really miss you. I want to meet everyone together and just chat.\" When a fan asked why he didn't sleep, Jimin replied, \"I woke up after sleeping earlier.\" He said 'it seems that' when another person asked if his 'night owl life started again'. Several fans wrote about shaving their hair, and not breathing if Jimin didn't reply to their comments. Reacting to it, the singer said, \"In order to get a comment you guys keep saying ‘I'm shaving my hair, I won't breath'. You guys are cute.

This is the first time the members shared pictures of meeting Bang Si-hyuk after their Las Vegas concert in April this year. Bang Si-Hyuk, is the person behind BTS' success.

RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook held a 35-minute long meeting with the US president. In his speech, RM thanked the US president for signing recent legislation on combating Covid-19 hate crimes in the country. \"We want to say thank you, sincerely, for your decision such as signing the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. So we just want to be a little help and we truly appreciate the White House and government’s (efforts) trying to find solutions,\" he added.

                                                        Producer Mike Dean woke up on the wrong side of the bed  Following Rapper Kanye West not winning the Album of the Year at Grammys 2022 with his recent release Donda 2, Mike Dean pinned his angst in the wrong direction, being the producer on the album, he apparently aimed his anger at BTS with his diss tweets on the South Korean mega act On April 4, the Recording Academy was crushing over BTS with a tweet that read, via ET Canada, \"Name a group ~smoother~ than @bts_bighit, we dare you  #BTSARMY #GRAMMYs,\" to which Dean replied with an unsolicited snarky tweet and wrote, \"Anyone \" Soon, the BTS ARMY gathered to condemn the producer for his hate comment on the group  Initially, Dean engaged with the comments even going as far as accusing the group of not being active participants in writing their own songs when a fan pointed out Dean's \"disgusting\" behaviour  He escalated the drama and wrote, \"There is no way BTS members have writen 90% of their music  Just check the writing credits of every single BTS album \" This enraged the fans and shocked them equally as the supposed \"beef\" came out of nowhere  Fans then began speculating that Dean's remarks must have been inspired after being rejected by the group, the confusion was later sorted out when Dean finally admitted his wrongdoings and tweeted, \"Ok folks  I was mad about album of the year and made a post I shouldn’t have made  My gf just made me feel bad for it \" Check out Mike Dean's hateful tweets toward BTS below:https://twitter

However, they have also asked for more time to share details about the much-awaited album amid collaboration speculations. “Jin will release his solo single at the end of October,” Soompi quoted the agency as saying. When asked about reports of collaboration between Jin and Coldplay, the rep commented, “The exact details of the date and time, collaboration, and more will be revealed later. We ask for your understanding.” Meanwhile, BTS members — RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook — will be soon joining the compulsory military service in South Korea. Jin will be the first one to begin his process for the same around October-end, after wrapping up his work commitments. Others will join as and when they are asked to. The agency said in a statement, “BIGHIT MUSIC is proud to announce today that the members of BTS are currently moving forward with plans to fulfill their military service. After the phenomenal concert to support Busan’s bid for the World Expo 2030, and as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it’s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honored to serve.” “Since the creation of BTS over ten years ago, the band has risen to international success, broken records, and catapulted K-Pop into the global stratosphere. BIGHIT MUSIC has focused to the milestone moment when it would be possible to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men to serve with their countrymen, and that’s now. Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October. He will then follow the enlistment procedure of the Korean government.

RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook were seen having a gala time performing flying yoga. The majority of the part included warming up and stretching so that the Bangtan Boys could not face a lot of difficulties while performing the postures on the hammock. After watching the episode of Run BTS, the boys fit into various categories of students. Yes, you read that right In the latest episode of Run BTS, Park Jimin aka Jimin was seen impressing not just the teacher but also the other members. Jimin was acing every posture that the teacher taught or showcased, and with ease too. The other members such as J-Hope, Suga, RM and Jin were impressed with Jimin's flexibility and agility. Jimin definitely fit in the ace of the class or the topper of the class category The Run BTS episode is the top trend in Hollywood News. Talking about the episode, Kim Namjoon aka RM and the Golden Maknae Jungkook were seen having a lot of fun. While Jungkook was goofing around a lot, RM was pretty chilled. They both managed to do the postures and have fun as well. So, they fit in the mischievous kind who managed to do tasks/pass category Kim Taehyung did not fuss about acing every posture and did his bit but was kinda laidback. He was pretty chilled on in the Flying Yoga class and didn't mind being a spectator when things seemed difficult. He comes in that category who work as much to just pass exams. Yep, that kind Min Yoongi aka Suga comes into that category wherein the student is very hard-working but lacks somehow. Suga was very sincere doing his best in every posture but he struggled a lot too. He also cheered on the members when they seemed tired In the latest episode of Run BTS, Jung Hoseok aka J-Hope was seen clueless about every posture and the teacher almost helped him every time. He struggled a lot as well. He tried to copy others but was very scared to attempt it. So, Hobi comes in the category of being clueless and scared category Kim Seokjin aka Jin belonged to the category who was poor in all subjects kinda category. Though he attempted everything with sincerity, Jin was seen struggling to survive on the basics as well. He entertained not just the teacher and the members but also the ARMY. In case you haven't seen the episode yet, here you go: Meanwhile, it was a joyous moment for the ARMYs when Big Hit dropped a teaser of Run BTS' episode a couple of days ago.

Those masterpieces...\" Sharing a photo of Suga's hair a fan wrote, \"Our Yoongi, even the hair on the back of your head is cute. J-Hope replied, \"As far as I remember, that hyung's (elder brother) back hair always fluttered like that at that time because he was just awake.\" When a fan pointed out that the members were wearing microphones in the video, J-Hope said, \"What I know is we need to wear microphones when we are filming videos for broadcasting station.\" A fan asked the rapper, \"Did you tell Jungkook about how to decorate Insta layout?\" He replied, \"I told him, 'It will be very hard' to decorate later.\" When asked which film he enjoyed recently, J-Hope said, \"Dr Strange 2!!! Make sure you watch the second post-credit scene!!\" Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness released last month.\n",

      "In this week&rsquo;s episode, it was flamboyance queen and hitmaker soloist CHUNG HA who was invited and it was just as chaotic as one would expect as the close friends talked about everything  While sitting on the floor and cracking open some snacks to chew on to, they reminisced about the many moments that strengthened their friendship \n",

      "From their first meet at their shared salon, to when they went viral because of their many funny moments  One of these incidents was when they sat beside each other in the artists section of the 2018 Mnet Asian Music Awards  As V returned to join the rest of the BTS members, there was not enough room for him and so he decided to grab a seat in front of them  Looking at this, CHUNG HA and Sunmi who were beside leader RM got up to offer their spot to V who gratefully accepted it \n",
      "\n",
      "The scene has since gone viral among the BTS ARMY who have been equally thankful for their kind gesture when K-pop idols are known to minimize their interaction to avoid rumors  The two were happy to receive praise from the fans of other artists  Check out their full discussion below \n",

I haven't been able to decide where to get it so I'm trying to decide quickly. Will you guys help me decide? I'll go get it done with Jungkook once I choose where I'll get it done.\" When a fan suggested that he should get the tattoo under the left toe, V said, \"I also thought about it.\" Recently, RM revealed that he got the tattoo inked on his leg while eagle-eyed fans discovered that Jimin got it on his finger. V spoke about Jungkook's new song My You, released ahead of BTS' ninth anniversary, and said, \"Jungkook's song? I heard Jungkook's song about a month ago... it's good, isn't it? Shall we listen to his song once? He made this song well!!\" He also sang My You and later Jimin's OST debut song, With You, from Our Blues. He also said, \"Our Blues…to be honest, from the 13th, 14th episode I’ve been crying at the end of every episode. It’s a show that I don’t think will come out again?\" After asking fans, \"you want me to turn on Run BTS?\" he started singing the song as well. V also took up the 'Bangtan Don’t Laugh for 22 minutes' challenge video as tweeted by @modooborahae. He said, “Everyone come in and if you’re ready, say 'Yes' on Weverse. Oh, are you ready? Go to 'try not to laugh BTS version for 20 minutes'. Which pic/clip did you say was fun? The Hangul Day special? Episode 86? But this is legendary? I definitely won’t smile. Okay, let’s go. What kind of expression can we have? We just can’t show our teeth. The vibe is already funny. Isn’t my hair more of a 'try not to laugh challenge'?” The BTS member also spoke about actor Gang Dong-Won and watching the screening of Broker. \"Oh, I saw the VIP screening well. I really liked how he came to my Las Vegas concert and I was thankful so I went to his. He’s my role model. I do have a lot of role models. But he’s from my hometown. He’s so handsome.\" BTS' V started the live an hour before Proof Live and as fans asked him to watch it with them, he said, \"I don't think that's possible.

I'm going to watch this but since there are people who only have a phone... please go to (the Proof live) quickly.\" Earlier he had said, \"Now all the music shows pre-recordings have finished.. since we have the Proof live at 9 PM, I thought I'll come on live until then.. since a lot of ARMYs came today but a lot couldn't come so you might be sad, I thought I'd come live for you guys.\" Soon after the Proof Live started, V signed off from his live session.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

      "Soon after some relentless training at JYP Entertainment that saw the members of Stray Kids being chosen, Han cemented his place in the group  Over the many years of being active as an idol, Han has had the opportunity to showcase his many skills and has even been called the 4th Generation ace  Why is that so? Let&rsquo;s find out \n",

      "Rap:\n",
      "It&#39;s no brainer that Han is a fabulous rapper  Alongside fellow Stray Kids members Bang Chan and Changbin, who complete the 3RACHA, he has released free-to-listen songs displaying his rap and song-writing skills  Penning down his own lines, the young idol has shared some very profound and developed thinking over the years \n",

      "Dance:\n",
      "Being in the world of K-pop, it&rsquo;s a given that one has to hone their dance skills  Stray Kids is known for their kalgunmu, which is basically their knife-sharp moves and Han stands as one of the 8 pillars of the team in every performance  Having participated in some of the most complex and demanding sequences, it is a sure-shot confirmation that Han is a skilled dancer \n",
      "\n",
      "Vocals:\n",
      "It is always surprising to see rappers give their everything for their singing  Han does just that and then some while holding the mix for a vocal part  He is possibly the member who can reach the highest tone and his many attempts at putting out vocal parts have been nothing short of brilliant \n",

More reserved? We can only wait to find out \n",

The biggest buzz on social media is created by BTS and BLACKPINK fans. They both have been trolling one another. As we know, BLACKPINK won the Best K-Pop of the year with Lisa's Lalisa song. It is a huge moment for the Thai singer who has made a name working in the K-Pop industry. Blackpink also got nominated in a couple of other categories. Many fans were surprised as the group had been on a hiatus of close to three years. In fact, their comeback song Pink Venom released when the eligibility period for the VMAs was over. These are the reasons why BTS ARMY is trolling and saying that Lisa's win was rigged If this was not enough, someone compared her win to that of Ananya Panday in the Filmfare Awards. We know how badly she was trolled, and is still trolled for her comment on struggle. A BTS fan from India placed pics of Lisa and Ananya Panday side by side and tweeted, \"THEY BOTH SIT ON THE SAME TABLE IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW! #AnanyaPanday #filmfare Well, Lisa's Lalisa is a superhit song and so is the B-Side number Money. BTS has also won the Best Group Of The Year award. Today, it is a day when trolls from BTS and Blackpink fandoms are going all out on social media       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

Hyun Bin a picture of BTS' Jimin, he went blank and struggled to recognise him. He opened his mouth, made a face and brought his fists near his eyes. Yoon-ah asked him, \"Will you be okay?\" As he smiled and joined his hands, Hyun Bin blurted out, \"Jimin.\" A seemingly embarrassed Hyun Bin asked the camerapersons, \"Please blur me\" and added, \"Whew. It is getting hot.\" Na PD then suggested, \"I will put Hyun Bin's face when we play this game with Jimin later. I will make him get the wrong answer. It will be a tie.\" Hyun Bin replied, \"No, it shouldn't be a tie. I don't want a tie.\" Confidential Assignment 2: International is a South Korean action film directed by Lee Suk-hoon. It is the sequel to the 2017 film Confidential Assignment. Apart from Hyun Bin and Im Yoon-ah, the film also stars Yoo Hae-jin, Daniel Henney, and Jin Seon-kyu. The film released earlier this month. Hyun Bin also has The Point Men, an action crime thriller film directed by Yim Soon-rye, in the pipeline. The film also stars Hwang Jung-min. BTS' Jimin along with group members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V and Jungkook will hold an in-person concert in Busan next month to promote South Korea's bid for World Expo 2030. The concert named BTS Yet To Come in BUSAN will be held at Asiad Main Stadium on October 15. Earlier it was supposed to take place at Busan Ilgwang special stage in Gijang-gun.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

I don’t really have any left.\" An ARMY asked Jin to do a live stream of him playing games and he replied, \"I almost destroyed my TV while playing Elden ring.\" A fan said that Jin will get a lot of ad offers, he said, \"I don’t do many ads because working to make ARMYs happy comes first rather than making money.\" When a fan suggested that they will look forward to a 'mukbang (an eating show) with drinking', Jin responded, \"I should do it with a member. Who should I eat with?\" A fan asked Jin to give them makgeolli (Korean alcoholic beverage) as they can drink it in four years. He said, \"They say if you don’t make a brand, it’s illegal to give alcohol. That’s why I couldn’t give it to the members either. I have to invite you to my house to drink it.\" \"Not to be dramatic but I'm going to die from a broken heart,\" said an ARMY. \"Oh no. And it will be cold for him too. I hope he will be able to pass this winter safely,\" said a person. Another fan wrote, \"This tore me up! I’m sorry I just can’t do this y’all.\" Last month, BTS agency BigHit Music announced the group members' mandatory military service. It said that the seven members would enlist in the military, putting an end to a debate about whether they should be exempt from the mandatory service requirement of about two years. Jin said he would sign up in December. The group has said they hope to reconvene by 2025.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

took only two minutes. During the interaction with fans, RM said in English, “It took 2 hours to stamp on the body to check the font and positions, but it took me only 2 damn minutes to have an actual tattoo on my body. It was only two lines. one line \"oh ouch\" 2nd line \"oh ouch\" and done.” Previously, RM had shared a glimpse of his friendship tattoo with fans, which seems to be the BTS leader’s tribute to his seven-member band. 7 was also the name of the BTS’ 2020 album. After the members discussed getting themselves inked on several occasions, J-hope, Jimin and Jin also have similar tattoos. Talking about tattoos, V earlier said on Weverse, “We’ve been talking about friendship tattoos forever. We’ll do it someday. Please look forward to it.” RM also once mentioned that members have had discussions about getting a friendship tattoo. \"Let’s tattoo seven dots or do seven of something. Or just simply tattoo the number seven. But if we’re actually doing it, I want to do it on the ankle. You know, it’s simple,” he said. Currently, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are on a break to focus on their individual career goals. Announcing their hiatus, RM had said while he enjoyed being in BTS, the group members now feel \"exhausted\" and he doesn't \"know what kind of group we were any more\".
